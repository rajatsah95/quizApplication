## Project Overview
### **Core Features**

- **Backend:**
    1. Use a database to store a few questions for one quiz. Each question has text, options, and a reference to the correct option.
    2. An endpoint to fetch all questions for a quiz (without sending the correct answers).
    3. An endpoint that takes the user's answers, calculates the score, and returns it.
- **Frontend:**
    1. A start page that lets the user begin the quiz.
    2. A view that displays one question at a time with its options.
    3. "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between questions.
    4. A "Submit" button on the final question that sends all answers to the backend.
    5. A final screen that displays the user's score.
